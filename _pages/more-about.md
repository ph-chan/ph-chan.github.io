More about me...
======
* Sports
  * Soccer
    * My favourite sport is soccer (football). I started watching it since 2007. My favourite teams are [Arsenal](https://www.arsenal.com/) (in England) and South China Athletic Association (SCAA, in Hong Kong). Sadly the latter no longer plays in professional soccer leagues since 2017.
    * I also play soccer for leisure. I usually operate at center back, right back or defensive midfield, but my favourite position is on the wings.
  * Badminton
    * I am a bad badminton player, but I do try to play badminton regularly.
  * Baseball
    * I developed an interest in baseball quite recently, but I like to watch [Toronto Blue Jays](https://www.mlb.com/bluejays).
  * Running
    * My long-term aim is to participate in a full marathon.
  * ... and most popular sports!

* Photography
  * I use SONY APS-C cameras.
  * I enjoy taking photos of animals, particularly birds.
  * I also enjoy taking scenic pictures whenever I travel.

* Anime
  * Strictly speaking, anime, manga, games, and light novels
  * One of my favourites is [Sword Art Online (ソードアート・オンライン)](https://www.swordart-online.net/)
