I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Statistical Sciences, specializing in actuarial science. I am interested in data analytic methods applicable to general insurance. In particular, I am looking at modelling and pricing of cyber risks and insurance.
I hold a Bachelor of Science in Actuarial Science degree from the University of Hong Kong. In my leisure time, he enjoys playing and watching various sports, photography, as well as appreciating anime and manga.
